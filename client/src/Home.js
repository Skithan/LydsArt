      My practice, rooted primarily in oil and acrylic painting, explores themes of childhood, nostalgia, and the
contradictions of change. I draw inspiration from the everyday--people, places, and connections that shape
our experiences. My work reflects an attentiveness to both the small details and the expansive: the softness
of light stretching across the sky, the sharp vibrancy of spring, and the fleeting moments that hold emotion
in their simplest forms.
<br></br>
As my practice continues to evolve, Iâ€™ve come to recognize how its themes echo past joys and the
elements of childhood I revisit as I move into adulthood. Much like my surroundings and experiences,
both past and present, my work mirrors this change, prompting shifts in style, theme, and subject.
